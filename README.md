## Job list with filtering data

The main aim of project is to practice React, Js, Redux. Also there is an attempt to understand difference between vanilla Redux and Redux toolkit.
Filters depend on which badges you have chosen, remove and add filters and see how your screen with vacancies changes. At this moment the data is taken from the mock json file, there is no server part.  
RTK version and vanilla are available, main branch: RTK version
